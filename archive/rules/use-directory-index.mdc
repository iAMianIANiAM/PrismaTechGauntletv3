# ðŸ“‘ Directory First Navigation Rule

When navigating or searching the codebase:

1. **ALWAYS consult the `directoryIndex.md` document FIRST** before initiating any codebase search
2. Use the directoryIndex to:
   - Identify relevant file locations
   - Understand component relationships
   - Map data flows between subsystems
   - Find key interface points
3. Only after extracting actionable navigation information from directoryIndex, proceed with targeted tool usage:
   - Targeted file reading
   - Specific directory listing
   - Focused code searches

**Compliance requirement:** Each codebase navigation session MUST begin with directoryIndex consultation. Document what you learned from the directoryIndex before proceeding with other search methods.
