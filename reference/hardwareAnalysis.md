# PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 - Hardware Analysis

This document assesses the recovered prototype hardware components against the functionality outlined in the TrueFunctionGuide.md document, determining their suitability for implementing the described features.

## Hardware Assessment

### Core Requirements from TrueFunctionGuide

The PrismaTech Gauntlet requires hardware capable of:
1. Detecting hand orientation and movement through an IMU sensor
2. Providing visual feedback via an LED ring
3. Processing input for four distinct operational modes (Idle, Invocation, Resolution, and Freecast)
4. Recognizing specific hand positions and gestures
5. Running animations and visual effects on the LED ring
6. Operating in a wearable, standalone form factor

### Component Suitability Analysis

#### ESP32-WROOM Development Board

**Advantages:**
- Dual-core processing (240 MHz Tensilica LX6) provides significant computational power for parallel processing of sensor data and LED control
- WiFi capability enables OTA updates as specified in the development roadmap
- Bluetooth support offers potential for additional connectivity features in future iterations
- 4MB Flash and ~520KB SRAM provide sufficient memory for animations and gesture recognition algorithms
- Multiple GPIO pins available for sensor interfacing and LED control
- I2C support for MPU9250 communication
- Proven reliability in the previous prototype

**Potential Advantages Over ESP32-S2:**
- Dual-core processing allows for better task distribution (e.g., one core for motion processing, one for LED control)
- Higher MIPS performance (dual-core vs. single-core)
- Addition of Bluetooth connectivity
- More mature ecosystem with broader community support

**Verdict:** The ESP32-WROOM is HIGHLY SUITABLE for this application. Its dual-core architecture provides better multitasking capabilities compared to the previously considered ESP32-S2, which will be beneficial when implementing the complex Freecast Mode that requires simultaneous sensor processing and LED animation.

#### MPU9250/6500/9255 9-Axis IMU

**Advantages:**
- 9-axis sensing (3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, and 3-axis magnetometer) provides all motion data needed for position detection
- 16-bit resolution enables precise detection of hand orientation and movements
- Digital Motion Processor (DMP) can offload sensor fusion tasks from the ESP32
- I2C interface simplifies connection to the ESP32
- Proven functionality in the existing prototype
- Additional magnetometer compared to MPU6050 could potentially enable more accurate orientation detection

**Alignment with Requirements:**
- The TrueFunctionGuide specifies a "Dominant Axis Detection Model" for hand positions, which is well-suited to the MPU9250's capabilities
- The sensor can reliably detect the six defined hand positions (Offer, Calm, Oath, Dig, Shield, and Null)
- The combined accelerometer and gyroscope data provides sufficient input for both position detection and the more complex motion analysis required for Freecast Mode
- While the magnetometer is not explicitly required by the TrueFunctionGuide, it may provide more accurate absolute orientation data that could enhance gesture detection reliability

**Verdict:** The MPU9250/6500/9255 is HIGHLY SUITABLE for detecting all required hand positions and gestures. The demonstrated success in the previous prototype confirms its effectiveness, and the additional magnetometer axis may provide opportunities for enhanced functionality or more robust position detection.

#### WS2812 12-LED RGB Ring

**Advantages:**
- Individually addressable RGB LEDs allow for complex patterns and animations
- 12 LEDs provide sufficient resolution for the described visual effects
- Single-pin control simplifies wiring
- Compatible with the FastLED library for efficient animation implementation
- Proven functionality in the existing prototype

**Alignment with Requirements:**
- The TrueFunctionGuide describes various LED patterns using specific segments of the ring (e.g., four cardinal LEDs for Idle Mode)
- 12 LEDs allow for three 4-LED segments as described for the Invocation slots
- The specified animations (fire patterns, scanning beams, rainbow effects) are all implementable with this LED ring
- The device is already capable of displaying the "Rainbow Burst" effect in response to the CalmOffer gesture

**Power Considerations:**
- Full white brightness for all 12 LEDs at maximum brightness would draw ~720mA
- Current implementation uses brightness level of 100 (out of 255), reducing power consumption to ~39% of maximum
- USB power can typically provide sufficient current, especially with the reduced brightness setting

**Verdict:** The WS2812 12-LED RGB Ring is SUITABLE for implementing all the visual effects described. Its successful implementation in the previous prototype with the FastLED library confirms its viability.

### Overall Hardware Compatibility

The recovered prototype hardware is EXCEPTIONALLY WELL-SUITED to implement the functionality described in the TrueFunctionGuide. The dual-core ESP32-WROOM offers enhanced processing capabilities, the MPU9250 provides comprehensive motion sensing with additional magnetometer data, and the WS2812 LED ring has proven effective for visual feedback. The precise configuration details provided further confirm the hardware's suitability.

## Existing Wiring and Configuration

The recovered prototype has the following confirmed configuration:

### LED Configuration
- **LED_PIN:** GPIO12 (not GPIO23 as originally thought)
- **NUM_LEDS:** 12
- **COLOR_ORDER:** GRB
- **LED_BRIGHTNESS:** 100 (out of 255, approximately 39% brightness)
- **Library:** FastLED

### I2C Configuration
- **SDA_PIN:** GPIO21
- **SCL_PIN:** GPIO22
- **I2C_CLOCK:** 100000 (100kHz)

### Connection Table

| Component | Pin on Component | Connected to ESP32 Pin | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| MPU9250 | VCC | 3.3V | |
| MPU9250 | GND | GND | |
| MPU9250 | SDA | GPIO21 | I2C Data Line (100kHz) |

### Power Analysis

The power distribution in the existing prototype follows standard practices:
- The ESP32-WROOM board is powered via its USB connection
- The MPU9250 uses the regulated 3.3V supply from the ESP32
- The WS2812 LED ring uses the 5V supply derived from the USB connection
- LED brightness is managed via software (set to 100/255) to conserve power

This arrangement is appropriate and should be maintained.

   - Consider dedicating one core to sensor processing and one to LED control

4. **Position Detection System:**

   - Develop and integrate the additional modes (Invocation, Resolution, Freecast)

## Testing and Verification

Before proceeding with software development, perform these basic tests to verify hardware functionality:
