## 3. Connectivity & Pinout

### 3.1 Pinout Overview
- **Digital GPIOs:** A wide range of digital I/O pins are available for interfacing with sensors, actuators, and other modules.
- **Analog Inputs:** Several ADC channels support analog sensor inputs.
- **Communication Interfaces:**  
  - **I2C:** Typically available on dedicated SDA and SCL pins.  
  - **SPI:** Multiple SPI pins for high-speed communication.  
  - **UART:** At least one hardware UART available for serial communication.
- **USB-C Port:** Used for both powering the board and programming it via the CP2102 interface.
- **VIN/5V and 3.3V:**  
  - **VIN/5V Pin:** Provides access to the USB’s 5V input; useful for powering external circuits (ensure you account for current limits).
  - **3.3V Pin:** Outputs regulated 3.3V for sensors or low-voltage devices.

*Note:* Refer to the included pinout diagram (provided in your package) for the exact layout and additional special function details.

## 4. Power and Voltage Considerations

- **USB Power:**  
  - The board is powered via the USB-C connector. When connected, it receives 5V from the USB port.
  - The onboard regulator steps this down to 3.3V for the ESP32.
- **Current Capacity:**  
  - Typical USB ports supply 500 mA to 900 mA (USB 3.0), but always check your power source.
  - The available current on the 3.3V line depends on the onboard regulator’s ratings; generally safe for sensors and low-power modules.
- **VIN Pin:**  
  - The VIN (or 5V) pin outputs the same voltage as supplied by the USB. This can be used to power other devices if within current limits.

## 5. Driver Installation & Software Setup

### 5.1 CP2102 USB-to-Serial Driver
- **Windows:**  
  - Most modern Windows versions (10/11) usually auto-install CP2102 drivers.  
  - If not, download the driver from Silicon Labs’ official website.
- **macOS and Linux:**  
  - CP2102 drivers are typically built-in. If issues arise, consult Silicon Labs’ support resources.

### 5.2 Development Environment Setup
- **Arduino IDE:**  
  - Install the “ESP32 Arduino” boards package using the Board Manager (follow instructions from Espressif’s GitHub repository).  
  - Select your board (e.g., “ESP32 Dev Module”) under Tools → Board.
- **PlatformIO:**  
  - Set the board to an ESP32 variant in your `platformio.ini` file.
- **ESP-IDF:**  
  - For more advanced development, download and install the ESP-IDF framework from Espressif.
- **MicroPython/CircuitPython:**  
  - ESP32 is well-supported in MicroPython; simply flash the firmware via the appropriate tool.

## 6. Basic Usage and Example

### 6.1 Blink Example (Arduino)

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

#define LED_PIN 2 // Modify this to match your board's onboard LED if needed

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);    // Start serial communication
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  delay(500);
}
```
- **Note:** Verify the correct LED pin from your board’s documentation. Some boards use different pins for the built-in LED.

### 6.2 WiFi and Bluetooth Connectivity
- **WiFi Setup:**
  ```cpp
  #include <WiFi.h>
  
  const char* ssid = "YourSSID";
  const char* password = "YourPassword";
  
  void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
    WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
      delay(500);
      Serial.print(".");
    }
    Serial.println("\nWiFi connected!");
    Serial.print("IP Address: ");
    Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
  }
  
  void loop() {
    // Your code here
  }
  ```
- **Bluetooth Setup:**  
  Use libraries such as `BluetoothSerial.h` to initialize Bluetooth (supporting both classic and BLE).

## 7. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- **Driver Issues:**  
  - Ensure the CP2102 driver is properly installed if the board isn’t recognized.  
  - Double-check cable quality; USB-C cables vary in data support.
- **Board Detection:**  
  - Verify the selected board in the IDE matches your ESP32 module.  
  - Reset or double-tap the RESET button if the board isn’t programming correctly.
- **Power Stability:**  
  - When powering multiple sensors or peripherals, confirm that the current draw does not exceed USB limits.
- **USB Communication:**  
  - Use `Serial.begin()` and check for data reception.  
  - Monitor for serial communication issues if unexpected resets occur.
- **Advanced Connectivity:**  
  - For simultaneous WiFi AP and STA modes, test configurations as dual mode may introduce complexity.
  - Bluetooth code can conflict with WiFi if not managed properly—refer to Espressif documentation for best practices on dual-mode operation.
