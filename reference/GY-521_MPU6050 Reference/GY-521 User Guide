# GY-521 MPU-6050 User Guide

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview of the MPU-6050  
- **Sensor Type:** 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU), combining a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope on a single chip.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - 16-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for each channel, enabling accurate and high-resolution sensor readings.  
  - I2C (I²C) interface for data communication.  
  - Embedded Digital Motion Processor (DMP) that can process complex 6-axis motion fusion algorithms internally (though the DMP usage can be somewhat advanced).  
- **Operating Voltage:** Typically 3.3V, but the GY-521 board often includes an onboard regulator, allowing input from ~3.3V up to 5V. Always verify the module’s labeling or datasheet to confirm.

### 1.2 The GY-521 Breakout Module  
The GY-521 is a popular breakout board for the MPU-6050 sensor. It typically has a voltage regulator and pull-up resistors for the I2C lines, simplifying usage with 5V microcontrollers like Arduino Uno or Mega. Key onboard components:  
- **MPU-6050 Chip**  
- **3.3V Regulator**  
- **I2C Pull-up Resistors**  

Pin labeling often appears on the board edges, e.g., `VCC`, `GND`, `SDA`, `SCL`, `XDA`, `XCL`, `AD0`, `INT`.

2. **Communication Protocol:** I2C (400 kHz fast mode or standard 100 kHz)  
3. **I2C Address:** Usually `0x68` (if `AD0` pin is grounded) or `0x69` (if `AD0` is pulled high).  
4. **Accelerometer Range:** ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, ±16g  
5. **Gyroscope Range:** ±250, ±500, ±1000, ±2000 degrees/second  
6. **Temperature Sensor:** Internal sensor (not super-accurate, but useful for compensation).

## 3. Pin Descriptions and Wiring

### 3.1 Common Pin Layout
- **VCC:** Power input pin. Supply 3.3–5V as indicated on your module.  
- **GND:** Ground reference.  
- **SDA:** I2C data line. Connect to microcontroller’s SDA pin.  
- **SCL:** I2C clock line. Connect to microcontroller’s SCL pin.  
- **INT:** Interrupt output (optional). Can signal data availability or motion interrupts.  
- **AD0:** I2C address select. Usually grounded (address = 0x68). If set high, address = 0x69.  

*(Some boards also break out `XDA`, `XCL`, or `FSYNC`, which are typically not required for basic usage.)*

### 3.2 Typical Connection to Arduino (5V logic)
1. **VCC → 5V** on Arduino (the onboard regulator will step down to 3.3V).  
2. **GND → GND** on Arduino.  
3. **SDA → A4** on Arduino Uno (or dedicated SDA pin on boards with separate SDA/SCL pins).  
4. **SCL → A5** on Arduino Uno (or dedicated SCL pin).  
5. **INT** (optional) → A digital pin if you plan to use interrupts.  
6. **AD0** (optional) → Typically GND for address 0x68.

### 3.3 Connection to 3.3V Microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32, ESP8266)
- **VCC** can still be 3.3V if your GY-521 does not require 5V. Confirm the onboard regulator presence.  
- **SDA/SCL** → The microcontroller’s I2C pins. No level shifting needed if both are at 3.3V.

## 4. Basic Usage

### 4.1 Initial Steps
1. **Mount and Wire** the GY-521 to your microcontroller.  
2. **Install I2C Libraries** for your development environment (e.g., Wire.h in Arduino).  
3. **Check I2C Address**: If your code doesn’t detect `0x68`, see if AD0 is high or if there’s a bus conflict.

### 4.2 Arduino Sketch Example

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>

const int MPU_ADDR = 0x68; // or 0x69 if AD0 is high

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Wire.begin(); // Initialize I2C
  
  // Wake up MPU-6050 from sleep mode
  Wire.beginTransmission(MPU_ADDR);
  Wire.write(0x6B); // PWR_MGMT_1 register
  Wire.write(0);    // set to 0 -> wake up
  Wire.endTransmission(true);
}

void loop() {
  // Request accelerometer registers (starting at 0x3B)
  Wire.beginTransmission(MPU_ADDR);
  Wire.write(0x3B);
  Wire.endTransmission(false);
  Wire.requestFrom(MPU_ADDR, 6, true); // 6 bytes => Accel X, Y, Z
  
  int16_t accelX = (Wire.read() << 8) | Wire.read(); // Combine high & low
  int16_t accelY = (Wire.read() << 8) | Wire.read();
  int16_t accelZ = (Wire.read() << 8) | Wire.read();
  
  // Convert raw values to 'g' if needed, based on ±2g scale
  float Axyz[3];
  float accelScale = 16384.0; // LSB sensitivity at ±2g
  Axyz[0] = (float)accelX / accelScale;
  Axyz[1] = (float)accelY / accelScale;
  Axyz[2] = (float)accelZ / accelScale;

  Serial.print("Accel X: "); Serial.print(Axyz[0]);
  Serial.print(" Y: ");      Serial.print(Axyz[1]);
  Serial.print(" Z: ");      Serial.println(Axyz[2]);
  
  delay(200);
}
```

*(The above snippet only reads accelerometer data. For gyroscope, read registers starting at 0x43.)*

### 4.3 Gyroscope Data
- **Gyro data registers:** 0x43 to 0x48.  
- **Sensitivity**: ±250 dps => 131 LSB/°/s, ±500 => 65.5 LSB/°/s, ±1000 => 32.8, ±2000 => 16.4.  
- Convert raw 16-bit values into °/s by dividing by the correct sensitivity factor.

## 5. Calibration & Tuning

1. **Offset Calibration:**  
   - The accelerometer and gyroscope may have offsets.  
   - A simple approach is to average readings when the sensor is still/level, then subtract that offset from subsequent measurements.  
2. **Temperature Compensation:**  
   - The MPU-6050 can drift slightly with temperature.  
   - If precision is paramount, read the onboard temp sensor (registers 0x41, 0x42) and apply temperature-based offsets.  
3. **DMP (Digital Motion Processor):**  
   - Advanced usage can offload sensor fusion (e.g., quaternion, pitch/roll/yaw) to the DMP.  
   - Typically requires additional libraries (e.g., Jeff Rowberg’s i2cdevlib).

## 6. Power Considerations

- **Supply Current:** ~3–4 mA, which is usually modest.  
- **Sleep Mode:** You can configure low-power modes by writing to PWR_MGMT_1 register, though usage is less common.  
- **Voltage Tolerance:** If your module is labeled 3.3–5V, it includes a regulator. If uncertain, measure the board’s VCC to confirm. Overvoltage on a bare MPU-6050 chip can damage it.

---

## 7. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

1. **I2C Scanning Failure:**  
   - Double-check wiring (SDA → SDA, SCL → SCL).  
   - Ensure you have pull-up resistors or rely on the module’s onboard pull-ups.  
   - Confirm the address (0x68 vs. 0x69).
2. **No Data / All Zeros:**  
   - Ensure the device is awake (PWR_MGMT_1 register = 0).  
   - Check if you are reading the correct registers in the correct order.
3. **Inaccurate Readings / Drift:**  
   - Perform offset calibration.  
   - Place the sensor on a stable, level surface for baseline.  
   - Consider filtering (e.g., complementary filter, Kalman filter) for smoothing data.
4. **Jumping or Noisy Data:**  
   - Use a lower range setting for higher resolution if possible (e.g., ±2g for accelerometer if you only expect small movements).  
   - Implement software filtering or smoothing in code.

## 8. Advanced Features

- **Interrupts:**  
  - The MPU-6050 can trigger an interrupt on motion detection or data ready. Connect `INT` pin to a microcontroller’s interrupt-capable pin for event-based reading.  
- **FIFO Buffer:**  
  - The sensor can store data in a FIFO to reduce microcontroller overhead.  
- **DMP for Sensor Fusion:**  
  - The built-in DMP can provide orientation data (quaternions, Euler angles) with less CPU usage. Requires specialized libraries.
