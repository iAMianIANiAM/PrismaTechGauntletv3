# Chronicle Transition Protocol

> A systematic process for transitioning between chronicle versions when a document reaches its 1000-line threshold. This protocol requires explicit user authorization before execution.

## Purpose
To maintain an organized, navigable project history while ensuring both concise current documentation and preservation of historical context.

## Protocol Structure

### 1. Threshold Detection Phase
- **Trigger**: Chronicle reaches or exceeds 1000 lines during routine updates
- **User Alert**: Claude alerts user that threshold has been reached
- **User Authorization Request**: Claude explicitly asks user for permission to initiate the Chronicle Transition Protocol
- **Persistent Reminders**: If user declines or does not respond, Claude will:
  - Issue reminder alerts with each attempted chronicle update
  - Warn that chronicle will not be updated beyond 1000 lines
  - Repeat request for authorization to initiate protocol

### 2. Preparation Phase (Upon User Authorization)
- **Create Chronicle Index**: If not already existing, create working/chronicle_index.md
- **Draft Summary**: Prepare structured summary of key points from current chronicle
- **Identify Key Content**: Tag critical decisions, insights, and references
- **Create Archive Directory**: Ensure archive/chronicles/ directory exists

### 3. Transition Phase
- **Add Final Entry**: Document the chronicle transition process itself
- **Archive Current Chronicle**: Copy current chronicle to archive/chronicles/
- **Create New Chronicle**: Generate new chronicle with version increment
- **Remove Original**: Delete original chronicle from working/ directory after successful archiving
- **Update Chronicle Index**: Add entry for the new chronicle with date range and key topics

### 4. New Chronicle Structure
- **Header**: Standard project header with version number
- **Migration Summary**: Comprehensive overview of previous chronicle content
- **Key Completed Components**: List of verified or implemented items
- **Active Work Streams**: Ongoing development efforts
- **Critical Decisions**: Important architectural or design decisions
- **Known Issues**: Unresolved problems or challenges
- **Reference Links**: Direct links to previous chronicles and key documents

### 5. Cross-Reference System
- **Reference Format**: [vX:LNNN-LNNN] for line ranges in previous chronicles
- **Key Decision References**: Include version-specific references when citing past decisions
- **Version Tags**: Tag new entries with version number for future reference

### 6. Verification Phase
- **Link Testing**: Verify all references and links function correctly
- **Content Check**: Ensure summary adequately captures key information
- **Continuity Verification**: Confirm no critical information was lost in transition
- **Redundancy Check**: Verify that the original chronicle has been deleted from working/ directory

## Alert Examples

When chronicle_v1.md reaches threshold:

1. Initial Alert:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Chronicle threshold of 1000 lines has been reached. Would you like to initiate the Chronicle Transition Protocol? This protocol can only be executed with your explicit authorization.
   ```

2. Reminder Alert (if not authorized):
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Chronicle threshold of 1000 lines has been exceeded. Chronicle will not be updated until the Chronicle Transition Protocol is authorized. Would you like to initiate the protocol now?
   ```

## Implementation Example

Upon user authorization, Claude will:

1. Copy chronicle_v1.md to archive/chronicles/chronicle_v1.md
2. Delete the original chronicle_v1.md from working/ directory
3. Create working/chronicle_v2.md with:

```markdown
# PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 - Development Chronicle (v2)

## üìã Migration Summary (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Key Completed Components
- [VERIFIED] Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD)
- [VERIFIED] Simplified threshold management
- [VERIFIED] Documentation-code conformity

### Active Work Streams
- [IN PROGRESS] Idle Mode implementation
- [PLANNED] Architecture mapping

### Critical Decisions
- Simplified threshold management [v1:L120-L150]
- Revised implementation approach [v1:L350-L380]
- Chronicle Transition Protocol [v1:L950-L1000]

### Known Issues
- Idle Mode implementation compatibility challenges [v1:L650-L700]

### Primary Reference Links
- [Chronicle v1](../archive/chronicles/chronicle_v1.md)
- [TrueFunctionGuide](../reference/TrueFunctionGuide.md)
```

4. Create/update chronicle_index.md with:

```markdown
# Chronicle Index

| Version | Date Range | Key Topics | Status | Link |
|---------|------------|------------|--------|------|
| v1 | 2025-03-28 to 2025-04-02 | UBPD Implementation, Threshold Management, Idle Mode | ARCHIVED | [chronicle_v1.md](../archive/chronicles/chronicle_v1.md) |
| v2 | 2025-04-02 to current | Architecture Mapping, Implementation Approach | CURRENT | [chronicle_v2.md](./chronicle_v2.md) |
