# PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 - Development Chronicle (v1)

> *This chronicle serves as the primary running journal of development activity and historical record for the PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 project. It contains ideas, test results, trial/error logs, decisions, and development plans.*

## üìã Migration Summary (2025-03-28)

üîç TBD: This chronicle was created as part of migrating to the Global Rules v2.3 framework. Previous development history can be found in working documents like `currentplan_v2.md`.

## üìå DECISION: Rule Migration Process

The project is transitioning to Claude Global Rules v2.3, replacing previous workflow documents with a standardized set of working documents:

- `chronicle_v#.md`: Primary running journal (this document)
- `roadmap.md`: Goal-focused project direction
- `directoryIndex.md`: Codebase structure mapping
- `glossary.md`: Shared terminology definitions

### Migration Timeline

1. Create initial working documents (chronicle, update glossary)
2. Activate Global Rules v2.3 in Cursor settings
3. Remove obsolete workflow documents
4. Begin operating under new rule framework

## üß† INSIGHT: Critical Workflow Improvements

From our workflow improvement analysis, we identified four key areas for improvement:

1. **File Existence Verification**: Ensuring documented files actually exist in codebase
2. **Implementation Status Tracking**: Standardizing status indicators ([PLANNED], [IMPLEMENTED], etc.)
3. **Git Backup Protocol**: Formalizing commit and push procedures
4. **Development Guiding Principles**: Establishing core philosophies to guide work

## üìå DECISION: Core Development Philosophies

1. **Implementation Before Documentation**: Never document features as complete before they exist in code
2. **Verification Is Required**: All implementations must be verified before being considered complete
3. **Small Changes, Frequent Commits**: Prefer small, focused changes with clear documentation
4. **Recover Before Extending**: Fix and verify existing functionality before adding new features
5. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Be explicit about status, intentions, and dependencies

## üìå DECISION: Git Workflow Standards

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <concise description>

<longer description if needed>

<reference to working documents or issues>
```

### Commit Types
- `feat`: New feature or component
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `refactor`: Code improvements with no functional changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### When to Commit
1. After implementing a complete, functional component
2. After making significant documentation updates
3. After fixing a bug or issue
4. At logical stopping points in development sessions
5. Before ending a development session

### When to Push
1. After completing a significant feature
2. At the end of each development session
3. Before making major system changes
4. After synchronizing working documents with code
5. At minimum, once per day when actively developing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: UBPD Implementation Status

The Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD) system is documented but missing from the codebase due to version control issues. This is the primary detection model for the device and requires implementation recovery as a top priority.

## ‚úÖ RESOLUTION: Global Rules Migration Complete

The migration to Global Rules v2.3 has been successfully completed. Key accomplishments:

1. Created and populated `chronicle_v1.md` with project history and decisions
2. Updated `glossary.md` with project-specific terminology and status indicators
3. Removed obsolete workflow documents (`workflow_improvement_plan.md`, `git_backup_protocol.md`)
4. Verified that `roadmap.md` and `directoryIndex.md` already use standardized status indicators
5. Established tagging conventions in the chronicle (üß† INSIGHT, ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE, ‚úÖ RESOLUTION, etc.)

This migration provides a more structured framework for project development while preserving critical information from previous workflow documents. All future development will follow the Global Rules v2.3 framework.

## üîç TBD: Next Development Focus

Priority development areas after migration:
1. UBPD implementation recovery
2. Hardware validation of UBPD
3. Component status verification
4. Documentation alignment with actual codebase state
