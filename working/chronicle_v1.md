# PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 - Development Chronicle (v1)

> *This chronicle serves as the primary running journal of development activity and historical record for the PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 project. It contains ideas, test results, trial/error logs, decisions, and development plans.*

## üìã Migration Summary (2025-03-28)

üîç TBD: This chronicle was created as part of migrating to the Global Rules v2.3 framework. Previous development history can be found in working documents like `currentplan_v2.md`.

## üìå DECISION: Rule Migration Process

The project is transitioning to Claude Global Rules v2.3, replacing previous workflow documents with a standardized set of working documents:

- `chronicle_v#.md`: Primary running journal (this document)
- `roadmap.md`: Goal-focused project direction
- `directoryIndex.md`: Codebase structure mapping
- `glossary.md`: Shared terminology definitions

### Migration Timeline

1. Create initial working documents (chronicle, update glossary)
2. Activate Global Rules v2.3 in Cursor settings
3. Remove obsolete workflow documents
4. Begin operating under new rule framework

## üß† INSIGHT: Critical Workflow Improvements

From our workflow improvement analysis, we identified four key areas for improvement:

1. **File Existence Verification**: Ensuring documented files actually exist in codebase
2. **Implementation Status Tracking**: Standardizing status indicators ([PLANNED], [IMPLEMENTED], etc.)
3. **Git Backup Protocol**: Formalizing commit and push procedures
4. **Development Guiding Principles**: Establishing core philosophies to guide work

## üìå DECISION: Core Development Philosophies

1. **Implementation Before Documentation**: Never document features as complete before they exist in code
2. **Verification Is Required**: All implementations must be verified before being considered complete
3. **Small Changes, Frequent Commits**: Prefer small, focused changes with clear documentation
4. **Recover Before Extending**: Fix and verify existing functionality before adding new features
5. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Be explicit about status, intentions, and dependencies

## üìå DECISION: Git Workflow Standards

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <concise description>

<longer description if needed>

<reference to working documents or issues>
```

### Commit Types
- `feat`: New feature or component
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes

5. Before ending a development session

### When to Push
1. After completing a significant feature
2. At the end of each development session
3. Before making major system changes
4. After synchronizing working documents with code
5. At minimum, once per day when actively developing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: UBPD Implementation Status

The Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD) system is documented but missing from the codebase due to version control issues. This is the primary detection model for the device and requires implementation recovery as a top priority.

## ‚úÖ RESOLUTION: Global Rules Migration Complete

The migration to Global Rules v2.3 has been successfully completed. Key accomplishments:

1. Created and populated `chronicle_v1.md` with project history and decisions
2. Updated `glossary.md` with project-specific terminology and status indicators
3. Removed obsolete workflow documents (`workflow_improvement_plan.md`, `git_backup_protocol.md`)
4. Verified that `roadmap.md` and `directoryIndex.md` already use standardized status indicators
5. Established tagging conventions in the chronicle (üß† INSIGHT, ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE, ‚úÖ RESOLUTION, etc.)

This migration provides a more structured framework for project development while preserving critical information from previous workflow documents. All future development will follow the Global Rules v2.3 framework.

## üîç TBD: Next Development Focus

Priority development areas after migration:
1. UBPD implementation recovery
2. Hardware validation of UBPD
3. Component status verification
4. Documentation alignment with actual codebase state

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: UBPD Hardware Validation Failure

Hardware validation testing of the UBPD implementation revealed a critical issue: after calibration, the system fails to detect any position, regardless of the gauntlet's orientation. This suggests a systemic issue with the threshold management approach.

Analysis indicates that the ThresholdManager's EEPROM-based persistence system is likely failing, and the overall approach introduces unnecessary complexity that contradicts our "Explicit Over Implicit" principle.

## üìå DECISION: Simplified Threshold Management Approach

After hardware validation testing revealed issues with the threshold management system, a decision was made to significantly simplify the threshold management approach:

1. **Remove ThresholdManager Dependency**: Eliminate the complex EEPROM-based persistence mechanism
2. **Use Static Defaults**: Store threshold values directly in Config.h
3. **Explicit Calibration Output**: Modify calibration to output copy-paste ready threshold values
4. **Direct Code Integration**: Users update threshold values by editing source code with calibration output

This approach aligns with our guiding principles:
- **Explicit Over Implicit**: Threshold values are directly visible in the code
- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: No hidden persistence mechanisms
- **Verification Is Required**: Values can be directly inspected and validated

## üìã PLAN: UBPD Simplification Implementation

### Phase 1: Remove ThresholdManager Integration
- Remove ThresholdManager.h includes from UltraBasicPositionDetector
- Modify UltraBasicPositionDetector to use local threshold array
- Add default thresholds in Config.h
- Update initialization to use these defaults

### Phase 2: Enhance Calibration Output
- Modify UltraBasicPositionTest to display calibrated values in copy-paste format
- Generate Config.h-compatible threshold definitions after calibration
- Retain calibration procedure but make it clear values must be manually applied

### Phase 3: Simplify Main Application
- Update main.cpp to remove ThresholdManager dependencies
- Ensure application uses simple, transparent threshold management
- Validate position detection works with default thresholds

### Phase 4: Verification
- Test calibration output
- Verify position detection with manually updated thresholds
- Ensure the entire system remains functional with simplified approach

This plan represents a return to basics and ensures threshold management follows our "Explicit Over Implicit" principle.

## ‚úÖ RESOLUTION: UBPD Simplification Implementation Complete

The simplified threshold management approach has been successfully implemented. Key changes include:

1. **Removed ThresholdManager Dependencies**:
   - Eliminated EEPROM-based persistence mechanism
   - Removed all ThresholdManager includes and function calls
   - Simplified code with direct default threshold usage

2. **Added Default Thresholds in Config.h**:
   - Created a `DEFAULT_POSITION_THRESHOLDS` array in Config namespace
   - Set reasonable default values for all positions
   - Made thresholds explicit and directly visible

3. **Enhanced Calibration Output**:
   - Added `outputCalibrationValues()` function to UltraBasicPositionTest
   - Generates copy-paste ready threshold values in Config.h format
   - Provides clear instructions for users to update thresholds

4. **Simplified UltraBasicPositionDetector**:
   - Replaced complex threshold loading with simple defaults
   - Refactored calibration to use local thresholds only
   - Maintained all essential functionality with less complexity

5. **Updated Main Application**:
   - Removed ThresholdManager from main.cpp
   - Ensured application uses simple threshold approach
   - Maintained core position detection functionality

This implementation aligns with our "Explicit Over Implicit" principle and makes threshold management transparent and directly controllable through source code. Hardware testing should now proceed with the simplified system in place.

## ‚úÖ RESOLUTION: UBPD Hardware Validation Complete

The simplified Ultra Basic Position Detection system has been successfully calibrated and tested on actual hardware. Key accomplishments:

1. **Successful Calibration**:
   - Completed calibration procedure for all six hand positions
   - Generated explicit threshold values directly from device
   - Confirmed reliable detection with the calibrated thresholds

2. **Simplified Threshold Management**:
   - Added threshold redisplay functionality ('t' command)
   - Captured threshold values from calibration process:
     ```cpp
     constexpr float DEFAULT_POSITION_THRESHOLDS[6] = {
       7.97f,  // POS_OFFER (Z axis positive)
       -7.53f, // POS_CALM (Z axis negative)
       10.28f, // POS_OATH (Y axis positive)
       -4.32f, // POS_DIG (Y axis negative)
       -5.09f, // POS_SHIELD (X axis negative)
       7.19f,  // POS_NULL (X axis positive)
     };
     ```
   - Updated Config.h with the calibrated values
   - Verified main application build and upload with new thresholds

3. **Position Detection Performance**:
   - Position detection is now working reliably with the calibrated values
   - Physical unit thresholds (m/s¬≤) provide intuitive and accurate detection
   - User reports that position detection "felt great"

This marks the completion of the UBPD implementation and hardware validation phase. The system now follows our core principles, particularly "Explicit Over Implicit," with threshold values clearly visible and directly integrated into the code rather than hidden in EEPROM.

## üß† INSIGHT: Threshold Tuning for Improved Responsiveness

User testing revealed that the OATH position was difficult to trigger in the main application. This provided an opportunity to demonstrate the advantages of the simplified threshold management approach.

### Adjustment Process
1. Identified that the OATH threshold (10.28f) was significantly higher than other thresholds
2. Lowered the value to 6.50f directly in Config.h
3. Quickly rebuilt and uploaded the main application

This kind of rapid fine-tuning is precisely why the explicit threshold management approach is valuable - we can make targeted adjustments to improve specific positions without complex calibration procedures or hidden state. The direct visualization of threshold values made it immediately apparent that the OATH threshold was an outlier compared to other positions.
