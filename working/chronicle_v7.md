# PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 - Development Chronicle (v7)

> *Current Date: 2025-03-31*
>
> *This chronicle serves as the primary running journal of development activity and historical record for the PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 project. It contains ideas, test results, trial/error logs, decisions, and development plans.*

## üìã Migration Summary (202503311615)

This chronicle continues the project documentation from [chronicle_v6.md](../archive/chronicles/chronicle_v6.md), which reached its organizational threshold. The transition was executed following the Chronicle Transition Protocol, ensuring continuity of project history while restructuring for clarity.

### Key Completed Components
- [VERIFIED] Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD) implementation
- [VERIFIED] MPU sensor data scaling and calibration
- [VERIFIED] Conversion to physical units (m/s¬≤)
- [VERIFIED] Idle Mode integration with position detection
- [VERIFIED] Proper position-to-color mapping in LEDs
- [VERIFIED] LongNull to LongShield transition for improved trigger reliability
- [VERIFIED] FreeCast Mode implementation with multiple pattern types
- [VERIFIED] Division-by-zero crash protection throughout rendering pipeline

### Active Work Streams
- [PLANNED] Invocation Mode development (CalmOffer gesture trigger fixed)
- [PLANNED] Resolution Mode planning
- [PLANNED] FreeCast Mode pattern refinement

### Critical Decisions
- [DECISION] Replacing LongNull gesture with LongShield for FreeCast Mode trigger
- [DECISION] Using conditional statements instead of type-mismatched template functions
- [DECISION] Shield blue color consistency across countdown visualization
- [DECISION] Global approach for animation timers in mode transitions
- [DECISION] Centralized ModeTransition enum in SystemTypes.h
- [DECISION] Using direct division protection instead of utility functions

### Known Issues
- No critical issues at this time - all major modes functioning as intended
- Potential minor visual refinements needed in FreeCast Mode patterns

## üìã Post-Transition Status (202503311615)

Following the successful completion of the Chronicle Transition Protocol, development work continues on the PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 project. The immediate focus remains on the implementation of Invocation Mode functionality, building on the now stable foundation of position detection, gesture recognition, and FreeCast Mode.

Key priorities for the next development phase:
1. Implementation of full Invocation Mode with position recording
2. Development of the 3-slot mechanism described in the TrueFunctionGuide
3. Visual feedback system for slot recording process
4. Transition logic from Invocation Mode to Resolution Mode

All core subsystems are now functioning correctly after addressing the FreeCast Mode crash issues. The division-by-zero protection measures have been verified through extensive testing, confirming the system's stability during all motion patterns. 

## üìã Implementation Failure Post-Mortem (202504010010)

‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: A catastrophic implementation failure occurred during the color reassignment plan execution. The main.cpp file containing the core program functionality was inadvertently overwritten with a newly created ColorTest.cpp test harness, effectively destroying the main application code. Recovery required a full Git revert to a previous working state, resulting in several hours of lost work.

üß† INSIGHT: This failure highlights two critical process weaknesses:
1. The proposed test harness (ColorTest.cpp) violated our guiding principle of "no more complex than absolutely necessary to function" - the LED patterns could have been verified during normal device operation without creating a separate test script.
2. Insufficient review of the implementation proposal on both sides allowed an unnecessarily complex approach to proceed without proper scrutiny.

‚úÖ RESOLUTION: The project has been successfully restored to a working state via Git revert. Moving forward, we'll implement a simplified color reassignment approach that:
1. Adds the necessary utility functions to centralize color references
2. Updates existing code without creating separate test harnesses
3. Makes minimal, focused changes to achieve standardization
4. Never replaces or overwrites core application files

üìå DECISION: All future implementation plans, especially those involving file creation or modification of core components, will receive heightened scrutiny to ensure alignment with our "minimum necessary complexity" principle. 

## üìã Color Standardization Implementation (202504011230)

‚úÖ RESOLUTION: Successfully implemented the color standardization plan across the codebase. The following changes were made in a single commit:

1. Updated Config.h color constants to the standardized color values:
   - OFFER: Purple (128, 0, 255)
   - CALM: Blue (0, 0, 255)
   - OATH: Yellow (255, 255, 0)
   - DIG: Green (0, 255, 0)
   - SHIELD: Pink (255, 105, 180)
   - NULL: Red (255, 0, 0)
   - UNKNOWN: White (255, 255, 255)

2. Updated SystemTypes.h HandPosition enum comments to reflect the new color names.

3. Updated AnimationData.h position color constants to match Config.h.

4. Updated LEDPatternMap.md documentation to reflect the standardized colors.

5. Added a Position Color Standardization section to the glossary.md.

The changes were implemented on a dedicated branch (colorChange) to allow for easy rollback if needed. Visual inspection confirms that the LED colors are now correctly matching the standardized values defined in the documentation.

üß† INSIGHT: Following the simplified approach significantly reduced implementation time from the original estimate of nearly 3 hours to approximately 45 minutes, while still achieving the core objective of color standardization. This reinforces our "minimum necessary complexity" principle.
