# PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 - Development Chronicle (v7)

> *Current Date: 2025-03-31*

> *This chronicle serves as the primary running journal of development activity and historical record for the PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 project. It contains ideas, test results, trial/error logs, decisions, and development plans.*

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Summary (202503311615)

This chronicle continues the project documentation from [chronicle_v6.md](../archive/chronicles/chronicle_v6.md), which reached its organizational threshold. The transition was executed following the Chronicle Transition Protocol, ensuring continuity of project history while restructuring for clarity.

### Key Completed Components
- [VERIFIED] Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD) implementation
- [VERIFIED] MPU sensor data scaling and calibration
- [VERIFIED] Conversion to physical units (m/sÂ²)
- [VERIFIED] Idle Mode integration with position detection
- [VERIFIED] Proper position-to-color mapping in LEDs
- [VERIFIED] LongNull to LongShield transition for improved trigger reliability
- [VERIFIED] FreeCast Mode implementation with multiple pattern types
- [VERIFIED] Division-by-zero crash protection throughout rendering pipeline

### Active Work Streams
- [PLANNED] Invocation Mode development (CalmOffer gesture trigger fixed)
- [PLANNED] Resolution Mode planning
- [PLANNED] FreeCast Mode pattern refinement

### Critical Decisions
- [DECISION] Replacing LongNull gesture with LongShield for FreeCast Mode trigger
- [DECISION] Using conditional statements instead of type-mismatched template functions
- [DECISION] Shield blue color consistency across countdown visualization
- [DECISION] Global approach for animation timers in mode transitions
- [DECISION] Centralized ModeTransition enum in SystemTypes.h
- [DECISION] Using direct division protection instead of utility functions

### Known Issues
- No critical issues at this time - all major modes functioning as intended
- Potential minor visual refinements needed in FreeCast Mode patterns

## ðŸ“‹ Post-Transition Status (202503311615)

Following the successful completion of the Chronicle Transition Protocol, development work continues on the PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 project. The immediate focus remains on the implementation of Invocation Mode functionality, building on the now stable foundation of position detection, gesture recognition, and FreeCast Mode.

Key priorities for the next development phase:
1. Implementation of full Invocation Mode with position recording
2. Development of the 3-slot mechanism described in the TrueFunctionGuide
3. Visual feedback system for slot recording process
4. Transition logic from Invocation Mode to Resolution Mode

All core subsystems are now functioning correctly after addressing the FreeCast Mode crash issues. The division-by-zero protection measures have been verified through extensive testing, confirming the system's stability during all motion patterns.
