# PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 - Development Roadmap

## IMPORTANT NOTICE: Version Control Issue

**This roadmap is being updated to reflect the current state of the codebase.** Due to version control issues, the Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD) system, which is the primary detection model for the entire device, was lost or never fully committed to the repository. We are focusing our recovery efforts on implementing this key component, which is essential for the device's functionality.

## Current Status
We have completed Phase 1 (Architecture and Foundation), Phase 2 (Hardware Interface Foundation), Phase 4 (Calibration Preparation), Phase 5 (Calibration Protocol Implementation), and Phase 6 (Test Environment Implementation). We've also made progress on Phase 3 (Basic Position Detection) with a functional but not optimal implementation.

We are currently in Phase 7, which focuses on recovery and UBPD implementation, following our Hybrid Plan that combines process improvements with the implementation of the Ultra Basic Position Detection system:

1. **Phase 1: Immediate Process Stabilization** [IN PROGRESS]
   - Git Backup Protocol finalization
   - Working Document Alignment
   - File verification system implementation

2. **Phase 2: UBPD Implementation** [PLANNED]
   - Core UltraBasicPositionDetector development
   - Test application implementation
   - Hardware verification

3. **Phase 3: Documentation and Integration** [PLANNED]
   - Final working document updates
   - Repository maintenance
   - Integration with main application

The basic PositionDetector class has been successfully implemented with the Point Detection Model (dominant axis approach) and tested on physical hardware. However, the Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD) system, which is the intended primary detection model for the entire device, still needs to be implemented based on our documented design.
