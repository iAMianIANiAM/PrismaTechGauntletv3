## Current Status
We have completed Phase 1 (Architecture and Foundation) and are making significant progress on Phase 2 (Hardware Interface Foundation). Both the MPU9250 Core Interface and LED Interface have been successfully implemented and tested on actual hardware. The MPU sensor implementation confirms that our approach of using raw integer data without complex scaling is effective, providing accurate and responsive readings. The LED interface has been implemented using the FastLED library with support for all required animations and position color mapping.

We have also created a main application that integrates both components, implementing a basic position detection system using the dominant axis approach. This integration will serve as the foundation for developing the complete position detection system and the required operational modes.

Next steps include implementing the Hardware Manager to coordinate both components, enhancing the position detection algorithm using the dominant axis approach, and beginning to implement the calibration protocol for position threshold determination.
