## Current Status
We have completed Phase 1 (Architecture and Foundation), Phase 2 (Hardware Interface Foundation), Phase 4 (Calibration Preparation), and Phase 5 (Calibration Protocol Implementation). We've also made substantial progress on Phase 3 (Basic Position Detection) with the Position Detector implementation and test environments.

The PositionDetector.cpp file has been successfully implemented using the Point Detection Model, with straightforward detection logic based on dominant axis thresholds. The implementation includes a simple averaging mechanism for noise reduction without hysteresis, and does not use confidence metrics as per user preference.

We've established a hybrid approach for testing with multiple environments in platformio.ini, allowing thorough testing of the position detection system with the calibrated thresholds. The test environments have been verified to build successfully, and the position detection has been validated on the physical device.
