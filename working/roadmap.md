## Current Status
We have completed Phase 1 (Architecture and Foundation), Phase 2 (Hardware Interface Foundation), Phase 4 (Calibration Preparation), Phase 5 (Calibration Protocol Implementation), and Phase 6 (Test Environment Implementation). We've also made substantial progress on Phase 3 (Basic Position Detection).

The PositionDetector class has been successfully enhanced with two detection approaches:
1. **Point Detection Model** - The original threshold-based approach using dominant axis detection
2. **Hand-Cube Orientation Model** - A new vector-based approach treating the hand as a cube with six faces

The Hand-Cube Orientation Model provides significant improvements in detection accuracy and reliability by using normalized 3D vectors and similarity calculations instead of fixed thresholds. It's designed to coexist with the original detection method, allowing seamless switching between approaches for testing and comparison.

We've created a comprehensive test environment (`env:vectortest`) with a dedicated test application (`VectorOrientationTest.cpp`) to showcase and fine-tune the new detection model. The implementation includes an interactive calibration interface, multiple display modes for debugging, and runtime mode switching capabilities.
