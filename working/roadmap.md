## Current Status
We have completed Phase 1 (Architecture and Foundation) and have made substantial progress on Phase 2 (Hardware Interface Foundation). Both the MPU9250 Core Interface and LED Interface have been successfully implemented and tested on actual hardware. The Hardware Manager integration is now complete and has been verified with physical hardware testing, with the LEDs properly responding to movement and the MPU sensor data being accurately reported.

The hardware verification confirmed several key aspects of our implementation:
1. The MPU sensor provides responsive and accurate motion data
2. The LED interface correctly displays position colors and animations
3. The Hardware Manager properly coordinates power states and initialization
4. All components work together coherently in the integration test

The next focus will be on completing the remaining items in Phase 2 (MPU9250 Data Processing and final verification) before moving on to Phase 3 (Basic Position Detection).
