> Last Updated: 2025-03-31

This roadmap provides a mid-weight summary of the project's direction, priority features, and development backlog, aligned with the detailed tracking in the chronicle and the specifications in the TrueFunctionGuide.

## Completed Development

- [VERIFIED] **Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD)**: Fully implemented, calibrated, and verified in test environments and production context.
- [VERIFIED] **Simplified Threshold Management**: Implemented with explicit Config.h values instead of EEPROM persistence.
- [VERIFIED] **Documentation System**: Implemented structured process for chronicle transitions and documentation maintenance.
- [VERIFIED] **Code-Documentation Alignment**: Completed systematic audit of directoryIndex, roadmap, and chronicle against codebase.

## Current Development Focus

### [IN PROGRESS] Idle Mode Implementation

The Idle Mode implementation is currently in progress with a focused plan divided into phases:

1. **Phase 1: UBPD Integration** (2 days)
   - Refactor IdleMode to use UltraBasicPositionDetector instead of PositionDetector
   - Update position handling to use PositionReading struct
   - Align with Config namespace constants
   - Ensure consistent CRGB color usage with FastLED

2. **Phase 2: Gesture Detection Refinement** (1 day)
   - Refine CalmOffer gesture detection according to TrueFunctionGuide
   - Update LongNull gesture detection with non-blocking countdown
   - Implement proper animation feedback for gestures

3. **Phase 3: GauntletController Integration** (1 day)
   - Update GauntletController to work exclusively with UBPD
   - Remove conditional compilation for position detection
   - Enhance mode transition handling

4. **Phase 4: Testing Environment Enhancement** (1 day)
   - Update test application with comprehensive functionality
   - Add diagnostic commands and tools
   - Create verification test suite

**Timeline**: 6 days total including verification (Target completion: 2025-04-06)

### [IN PROGRESS] Architecture Mapping

- Building accurate mental model of codebase structure
- Documenting component relationships and communication patterns
- Creating sequence diagrams for key operations
- Identifying potential areas for simplification

## Next Immediate Steps

1. [PLANNED] **Begin Phase 1 of Idle Mode Implementation**: Start UBPD integration following the approved plan
2. [PLANNED] **Complete Animation System Architecture Documentation**: Map animation system to ensure proper integration with Idle Mode
3. [PLANNED] **Enhance Pre-Proposal Checklist**: Create standardized implementation proposal verification checklist

## Future Development

- [PLANNED] **Invocation Mode Development**: Implement mode for activating prime functions
- [PLANNED] **Resolution Mode Development**: Implement mode for active function execution
- [PLANNED] **Freecast Mode Development**: Implement mode for custom function definition
