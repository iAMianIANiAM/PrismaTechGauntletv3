## Current Status
We have completed Phase 1 (Architecture and Foundation), Phase 2 (Hardware Interface Foundation), Phase 3 (Basic Position Detection), Phase 4 (Calibration Preparation), Phase 5 (Calibration Protocol Implementation), and Phase 6 (Test Environment Implementation).

The position detection system has been successfully implemented with the UltraBasicPositionDetector, which provides reliable and accurate position detection using a simple yet effective approach. After multiple iterations and testing different approaches, the ultra-simplified position detection system has proven to be the most reliable and effective solution, exceeding the performance of the previous ECHO implementation.

We're now ready to begin implementation of Phase 7 (Mode Implementation), starting with the Idle Mode that will use our successful position detection system to provide real-time visual feedback based on hand position.
