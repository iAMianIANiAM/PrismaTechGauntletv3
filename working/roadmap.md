## Current Status
We have completed Phase 1 (Architecture and Foundation) and have made substantial progress on Phase 2 (Hardware Interface Foundation). The MPU9250 Core Interface and LED Interface have been successfully implemented and tested on actual hardware. The Hardware Manager integration is complete and has been verified with physical hardware testing.

The Calibration Protocol has been successfully implemented and tested. We have successfully transitioned the sensor placement from the forearm back to the back of the hand, which was the original design intention. We have developed robust utilities for data collection and analysis, which have generated position detection thresholds that have been integrated into the Config.h file.

We are now focused on implementing the PositionDetector.cpp file to utilize these thresholds for the Point Detection Model, followed by creating the basic position visualization in Idle Mode to test and validate the detection system.
