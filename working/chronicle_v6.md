> *This chronicle serves as the primary running journal of development activity and historical record for the PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 project. It contains ideas, test results, trial/error logs, decisions, and development plans.*

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Summary (202503292350)

This chronicle continues the project documentation from [chronicle_v5.md](../archive/chronicles/chronicle_v5.md), which reached its organizational threshold. The transition was executed following the Chronicle Transition Protocol, ensuring continuity of project history while restructuring for clarity.

### Key Completed Components
- [VERIFIED] Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD) implementation
- [VERIFIED] MPU sensor data scaling and calibration
- [VERIFIED] Conversion to physical units (m/sÂ²)
- [VERIFIED] Idle Mode integration with position detection
- [VERIFIED] Proper position-to-color mapping in LEDs
- [VERIFIED] Serial monitor position name display
- [IMPLEMENTED] Protocol violation recovery process

### Active Work Streams
- [PLANNED] Gesture detection implementation (CalmOffer, LongNull)
- [PLANNED] Invocation Mode development
- [PLANNED] Resolution Mode planning
- [PLANNED] Freecast Mode design

### Critical Decisions
- [DECISION] Adoption of ECHO reference scaling factor (0.0001220703125f * 9.81f) 
- [DECISION] Making processRawData() method public for consistent data processing
- [DECISION] Explicit data processing approach at each sensor data usage point
- [DECISION] Protocol discipline reinforcement after violation incident
- [DECISION] Project directory stability in standard location

### Known Issues
- None critical at this time - UBPD milestone successfully completed

## ðŸ“‹ Gesture Detection System Planning (202503292350)

With the successful implementation of the UBPD system in the main program environment and completion of the Idle Mode functionality, development focus now shifts to gesture detection. The next step is to implement the two core gestures described in the TrueFunctionGuide:

1. **CalmOffer Gesture**: Transition from "Calm" position (palm-down) to "Offer" position (palm-up) within a 1000ms window
2. **LongNull Gesture**: Maintaining the "Null" position (hand to side, palm in) for 5000ms with a countdown starting at 3000ms

These gestures will serve as the triggers for Invocation Mode and Freecast Mode respectively, forming the foundation of the gauntlet's interactive capabilities.
