# Current Development Plan - PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 (v2)

## Current Project Status Assessment

The project has experienced a significant setback due to version control issues, resulting in a discrepancy between the documented implementations and the actual codebase. This document represents our current understanding of the project status and the plan to recover and move forward.

### Current Issues

1. **Missing Primary Detection Model**: The Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD) system, which is the primary detection model for the entire device, is missing from the codebase despite being described in detail in working documents.

2. **Version Control Inconsistency**: There appears to be a significant disconnect between the git repository's state and the documented progress, suggesting issues with commit procedures or backup protocols.

3. **Documentation vs. Reality Mismatch**: The working documents (roadmap.md, directoryIndex.md, and previous currentplan.md) describe functionality and files that do not exist in the current codebase.

### What We Currently Have

Based on our analysis of the existing codebase:

1. **Hardware Interface Layer**: The MPU9250 interface, LED interface, and Hardware Manager implementations appear to be present and functional.

2. **Position Detection Core**: The basic Position Detector using the Point Detection Model (dominant axis approach) is implemented and functional. However, this is not the final optimized UBPD approach that was intended to be used.

3. **Calibration Protocol**: The calibration protocol for collecting position data and generating thresholds is present.

4. **Test Environments**: Several test environments for hardware and position detection testing exist in the platformio.ini file.

### What's Missing

1. **Ultra Basic Position Detection (UBPD)**: The primary detection model for the entire device is missing from the codebase. This model was designed to:
   - Convert sensor data into meaningful real-world units (m/s²)
   - Implement an optimized detection algorithm with absolute thresholds
   - Provide a simplified yet robust calibration protocol
   - Offer superior reliability through clear, direct data processing
   - The actual implementation files (`UltraBasicPositionDetector.h/cpp` and `/examples/component_tests/UltraBasicPositionTest.cpp`) must be recreated.

2. **ECHO Document**: Referenced ECHO documentation that would provide insights from previous implementations is not present.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: The other detection models documented (Hand-Cube Orientation Model and Hybrid Position Detection) were experimental approaches that proved overly complex and less reliable in testing. These do NOT need to be recovered. Our focus is solely on recovering and implementing the UBPD model, which is the intended final detection approach for the device.

## Recovery and Forward Plan

### Phase 1: Stabilization and Assessment ✓

1. **Harmonize Working Documents and Codebase**: Update all working documents (roadmap.md, directoryIndex.md, and this currentplan_v2.md) to accurately reflect the current state of the codebase.
   - [x] Create UBPD.md to preserve knowledge about the Ultra Basic Position Detection approach
   - [x] Update directoryIndex.md to accurately reflect existing files and their purpose
   - [x] Update roadmap.md with revised timelines and completion status

2. **Repository Stabilization**: Ensure local and remote repositories are in sync and properly backed up.
   - [x] Verify current state of local git repository
     - Local repository exists with commit history
     - Local branch is ahead of origin/main by 4 commits
     - Multiple uncommitted changes present in the working directory
   - [x] Check remote repository status and synchronization
     - Remote repository is set up at https://github.com/iAMianIANiAM/PrismaTechGauntletv3.git
     - Local changes need to be pushed to synchronize
   - [x] Establish proper backup procedures to prevent future data loss
     - Created git_backup_protocol_draft.md with detailed backup procedures
     - Protocol includes commit, push, and branch management guidelines
     - Includes verification steps to ensure repository integrity
   - [x] Create a recovery branch to track our rebuilding efforts
     - Branch 'recovery-phase1' successfully created and active
     - Recovery branch will be used for all Phase 1 rebuilding work

3. **Code Inventory and Verification**: Thoroughly catalog all existing code to confirm what's actually present and functional.
   - [x] List all implementation files and their current status
     - Hardware layer implemented: HardwareManager, MPU9250Interface, LEDInterface, PowerManager
     - Position detection: PositionDetector (basic implementation) present without UBPD
     - Calibration protocol present and functional
     - Gesture recognition interface defined but not fully implemented
   - [x] Verify build status of all environments in platformio.ini
     - Active production environment: esp32dev
     - Active test environments: idletest, simplepostest, postest, calibration, hwmtest
     - Several archived test environments commented out for reference
   - [x] Document any compilation errors or runtime issues
     - Created code_verification_plan.md with specific build verification steps
     - Listed commands to test runtime functionality of key components
   - [x] Create a priority list focusing on UBPD implementation
     - Defined implementation order in code_verification_plan.md
     - Established file requirements, implementation sequence, and validation strategy

### Phase 2: Process Improvement

1. **Workflow and Rules Review**: Assess our development workflow to prevent similar issues in the future.
   - [x] Review working document usage patterns
   - [x] Analyze our version control practices
   - [x] Identify points of failure in our backup procedures
   - [x] Develop recommendations for workflow improvements
   - [x] Create detailed implementation plan for priority improvements in working/workflow_improvement_plan.md

2. **Git Backup Protocol Implementation**: Create and implement a formal git backup protocol.
   - [ ] Draft backup protocol rules with clear steps and timing
     - Initial draft created: working/git_backup_protocol_draft.md
     - Needs review and finalization in Phase 2
   - [ ] Define triggers for backups (code milestones, time intervals)
   - [ ] Establish verification procedures for backup success
   - [ ] Create automation scripts if appropriate

3. **Documentation Improvements**: Enhance our documentation practices to better track implementation status.
   - [ ] Add implementation status tracking to directoryIndex.md
   - [ ] Create file existence verification in our review process
   - [ ] Improve cross-referencing between documentation and code

### Phase 3: Implementation Recovery

1. **ECHO Document Integration**: Import missing ECHO document to provide insights from previous implementation.
   - [ ] Locate and integrate the ECHO document
   - [ ] Extract key lessons and implementation details
   - [ ] Update references in working documents

2. **Ultra Basic Position Detection Implementation**: Rebuild the UBPD implementation based on our documentation.
   - [ ] Create UltraBasicPositionDetector.h/.cpp files with:
     - [ ] Physical unit conversion (raw data to m/s²)
     - [ ] Simplified detection logic with absolute thresholds
     - [ ] Position-specific threshold management
     - [ ] Streamlined calibration process
   - [ ] Implement UltraBasicPositionTest.cpp
   - [ ] Add ultrabasic environment to platformio.ini
   - [ ] Test and validate the implementation on physical hardware

## Key Priorities

1. **Stabilize/harmonize working documents, codebase, and git repo** (both local and remote). This is our starting point, as rough as it is, and we're going to make that ground as solid as we can.

2. **Perform a workflow/rules review**. We'll assess our workflow, including working document usage and general protocols. We're not going to undertake any major changes, but want to consider a careful analysis. We will, however, be drafting and implementing a rule specifying exactly what the git backup protocol is going to be moving forward, to avoid a similar catastrophe.

3. **Bring in the missing ECHO document** and, combined with our new UBPD.md, rebuild the Ultra Basic Position Detection system as the primary detection model for the device.

## Next Steps

**Phase 1 Complete**: All stabilization and assessment tasks have been completed successfully. The current state of the project is now properly documented, and a recovery branch has been established.

2. Begin Phase 2: Process Improvement
   - Review working document usage patterns
   - Analyze version control practices
   - Identify points of failure in backup procedures
   - Finalize the git backup protocol

3. Prepare for Phase 3: Implementation Recovery
   - Locate and integrate the missing ECHO document
   - Begin planning for UBPD implementation based on documentation

This plan represents our path forward to recover from the current setback and rebuild the project on a more stable foundation. We will proceed methodically, ensuring that our documentation accurately reflects reality at each step, and that our version control practices prevent similar issues in the future.
