# Current Development Plan - PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 v2

## Current Status: Position Detection System Successfully Implemented ✅

The PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 has achieved a major milestone with the successful implementation and verification of a reliable position detection system. After multiple iterations and approaches, we've developed an ultra-simplified position detection implementation that delivers exceptional performance and reliability.

## Key Achievements

### Position Detection System ✅
- Implemented UltraBasicPositionDetector with direct dominant axis detection
- Created simple yet effective 3-sample averaging for noise reduction
- Developed straightforward calibration protocol that generates reliable thresholds
- Successfully verified on hardware with excellent position recognition
- Position detection performance exceeds previous ECHO implementation

### System Architecture ✅
- Completed layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Established hardware abstraction layer for sensor and LED control
- Developed robust error handling throughout the system
- Created comprehensive test environments for all components

### Hardware Interface Foundation ✅
- Implemented MPU9250/6050 interface with raw integer approach
- Created FastLED-based LED control system with animation capabilities
- Developed unified HardwareManager to coordinate all hardware components
- Verified all hardware functionality on the physical device

### Test Infrastructure ✅
- Developed multiple test environments for different components
- Created dedicated calibration environment with data collection tools
- Implemented comprehensive test applications for each detection approach
- Organized test code with clear TEST_MODE preprocessor guards

## Next Development Phases

### 1. Idle Mode Implementation
The next immediate focus is to implement the Idle Mode using our successful position detection system:
- Integrate UltraBasicPositionDetector with IdleMode class
- Implement continuous position monitoring with visual feedback
- Add transition animations between detected positions
- Create position change event handling

### 2. Gesture Recognition System
With reliable position detection in place, we can now build the gesture recognition system:
- Develop position sequence tracking
- Implement time-based gesture detection
- Create CalmOffer and LongNull gesture recognition
- Add gesture feedback animations

### 3. Invocation Mode
Once gesture recognition is in place, we'll implement the Invocation Mode:
- Design state machine for spell invocation
- Implement animation effects for active spells
- Create timeout handling for spell sustainability
- Develop transition back to Idle Mode

## Implementation Plan

### 1. IdleMode Implementation (1-2 days)
- Integrate UltraBasicPositionDetector with IdleMode class
- Implement position-to-color mapping with smooth transitions
- Create event system for position changes
- Add debug interface for position monitoring

### 2. GestureRecognizer Implementation (2-3 days)
- Develop position history tracking
- Implement gesture pattern matching algorithms
- Create gesture event system
- Add visual feedback for detected gestures

### 3. GauntletController Implementation (2-3 days)
- Implement mode state machine
- Develop mode transition handling
- Create user feedback system
- Implement power management integration

## Notes and Considerations

- The UltraBasicPositionDetector has proven to be the most reliable approach and should be the focus of future development
- Maintain the raw integer approach for sensor data throughout the project
- Continue using FastLED's optimized functions for complex animations
- Focus on implementing the IdleMode next to build on our position detection success
- Begin developing the gesture recognition system based on position sequence detection
