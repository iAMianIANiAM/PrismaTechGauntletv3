## ðŸ“‹ Migration Summary (202504022026)

This chronicle continues the project documentation from [chronicle_v8.md](../archive/chronicles/chronicle_v8.md), which reached its organizational threshold. The transition was executed following the Chronicle Transition Protocol, ensuring continuity of project history while restructuring for clarity.

### Key Completed Components
- [VERIFIED] QuickCast Spells functionality detection and repair
- [VERIFIED] Enhanced Rainbow Burst QuickCast spell effect
- [VERIFIED] Extended Lumina spell duration to 60 seconds
- [VERIFIED] Lightweight Universal Troubleshooting Toolkit (LUTT) implementation

### Active Work Streams
- [IN PROGRESS] LUTT diagnostic integration in codebase
- [PLANNED] Universal "ShakeCancel" gesture implementation
- [PLANNED] Further QuickCast spell animation refinements

### Critical Decisions
- [DECISION] Pivot from gesture-based Lumina cancellation to universal "ShakeCancel" gesture
- [DECISION] Transition from RUTT to LUTT for diagnostics to maintain simplicity
- [DECISION] Phase-based animation approach for complex visual effects

### Known Issues
- [ISSUE] No universal cancellation mechanism for long-running spells
