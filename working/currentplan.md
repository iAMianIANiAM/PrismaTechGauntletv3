# PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 - Current Development Plan

This document provides a detailed outline of our current work focus, priorities, and implementation strategies.

## Current Focus: Software Development for Recovered Prototype

### Completed Tasks
- Set up project documentation structure
  - Created roadmap.md outlining the development phases
  - Created currentplan.md (this document) to track current work
  - Created directoryIndex.md to document project structure
- Analyzed reference materials
  - Reviewed TrueFunctionGuide.md to understand operational requirements
  - Examined hardware specifications of all components
- Created hardware documentation
  - Documented component specifications in hardwareSpecifications.md
  - Analyzed hardware suitability in hardwareAnalysis.md
  - Updated documentation to reflect the recovered prototype hardware configuration
- Initialized Git repository
  - Created initial commit with project structure
  - Connected to GitHub remote repository

### Current Tasks in Progress
- Hardware verification
  - Documenting precise hardware configuration from the recovered prototype
  - Planning hardware testing routines to verify functionality

### Implementation Details
- Hardware configuration in the recovered prototype:
  - ESP32-WROOM dual-core controller
  - MPU9250/6500/9255 9-axis IMU
  - WS2812 12-LED RGB Ring
  
- Specific configuration parameters:
  - **LED Configuration:**
    - LED_PIN: GPIO12 (not GPIO23 as initially documented)
    - NUM_LEDS: 12
    - COLOR_ORDER: GRB
    - LED_BRIGHTNESS: 100 (out of 255)
    - Using FastLED library
  
  - **I2C Configuration:**
    - SDA_PIN: GPIO21
    - SCL_PIN: GPIO22
    - I2C_CLOCK: 100000 (100kHz)
    - MPU_ADDR: 0x68
  
- Existing software capabilities:
  - WiFi connectivity for OTA updates and telnet debugging
  - Basic gesture detection (palm-down to palm-up)
  - Rainbow Burst effect in response to CalmOffer gesture

### Next Steps
1. Hardware verification:
   - Test I2C communication with the MPU9250 sensor at address 0x68
   - Test WS2812 LED ring functionality using GPIO12 data pin
   - Verify existing gesture detection capability
   - Document the confirmed hardware connections

2. Software structure assessment:
   - Analyze the existing codebase structure
   - Identify components to build upon
   - Plan refactoring of code to implement full TrueFunctionGuide functionality

3. Idle Mode enhancement:
   - Develop complete position detection system using the Dominant Axis Detection Model
   - Implement full visual feedback for all hand positions
   - Enhance gesture recognition system to detect both CalmOffer and LongNull gestures

4. WiFi and OTA refinement:
   - Ensure robust WiFi connection management
   - Implement comprehensive OTA update mechanism
   - Add web-based configuration interface if feasible
