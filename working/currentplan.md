   - Start calibration mode via serial command
   - LEDs provide visual feedback of active calibration

2. **Data Collection Phase** (for each position):
   - Visual prompt for specific position
   - 3-second countdown animation
   - 2-second data collection period (50+ samples)
   - Visual confirmation of successful collection
   - Automatic advance to next position

3. **Data Processing Phase**:
   - Calculate average values for each axis per position
   - Determine standard deviations and confidence bounds
   - Generate thresholds that maximize position separation
   - Store calibration values in non-volatile memory

4. **Data Format**:
   - CSV format with timestamp, position, and 6-axis data
