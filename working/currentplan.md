## Current Focus: MPU and LED Integration

The project has made significant progress with the successful implementation and hardware testing of both the MPU sensor and LED interfaces. We have created a main application that:

1. **Successfully integrates both hardware components**:
   - Initializes and configures the MPU sensor
   - Initializes and controls the WS2812 LED ring
   - Implements auto-detection of MPU address

2. **Implements a basic position detection system**:
   - Identifies the dominant acceleration axis
   - Determines the axis direction (positive/negative)
   - Maps the orientation to hand positions
   - Provides visual feedback using corresponding position colors

3. **Uses non-blocking design patterns**:
   - Separate timing for sensor reading and LED updates
   - Preserves system responsiveness
   - Prioritizes sensor reading over visual feedback

This integration serves as a foundation for developing the complete position detection system and implementing the required operational modes.

## Directory Structure

The implementation follows a modular organization:

```
/src
  /core         - System management and core structures
  /hardware     - Hardware interfaces for sensors and LEDs
  /detection    - Position and gesture detection logic
  /modes        - Mode-specific implementation handlers
  /animation    - LED animation system
  /utils        - Support utilities
/examples       - Standalone example applications
```

## Key Components

1. **GauntletController**: Central coordinator managing the system operation
2. **HardwareManager**: Manages sensors, LEDs, and power states
3. **PositionDetector**: Implements the Dominant Axis Detection model
4. **GestureRecognizer**: Detects CalmOffer and LongNull gestures
5. **AnimationSystem**: Manages LED visual effects for all modes

## Implementation Highlights

- Robust error detection and recovery in the MPU9250 interface
- FastLED library for efficient LED control and animations
- Raw integer data approach for sensor readings to avoid scaling issues
- Non-blocking design pattern for responsive operation
- Comprehensive test applications for each hardware component

## Notes and Considerations

- Maintain the raw integer approach for sensor data throughout the project
- Use FastLED's optimized functions for complex animations
- Focus on integrating the Hardware Manager next
- Begin developing the position detection algorithm based on dominant axis
- Add more sophisticated gesture detection building on position detection

## Recent Project Housekeeping

The project structure has been improved with the following housekeeping tasks:

1. **Test Directory Reorganization**
   - Created a structured test directory organization
   - Moved test files from src/ to test/mpu/
   - Created a dedicated helpers directory in test/
   - Added README.md with comprehensive documentation for the test structure

2. **Dependency Cleanup**
   - Confirmed successful transition from Adafruit_NeoPixel to FastLED
   - Verified no residual references to the old library
   - Updated platformio.ini to reflect the new library requirements

3. **Build Environment Improvements**
   - Added specific build environment for unit tests in platformio.ini
   - Removed redundant test files from src/ and examples/ directories
   - Updated directory index documentation to reflect the new structure

The codebase is now more organized with a clear separation between application code and test code, making maintenance easier and reducing potential confusion during development.
