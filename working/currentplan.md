# PrismaTech Gauntlet 3.0 - Current Development Plan

This document provides a detailed outline of our current work focus, priorities, and implementation strategies.

## Current Focus: Project Initialization and Hardware Planning

### Completed Tasks
- Set up project documentation structure
  - Created roadmap.md outlining the development phases
  - Created currentplan.md (this document) to track current work
  - Created directoryIndex.md to document project structure
- Analyzed reference materials
  - Reviewed TrueFunctionGuide.md to understand operational requirements
  - Examined hardware specifications of all components
- Created hardware documentation
  - Documented component specifications in hardwareSpecifications.md
  - Analyzed hardware suitability in hardwareAnalysis.md
  - Defined pin assignments and wiring instructions
- Initialized Git repository
  - Created initial commit with project structure
  - Connected to GitHub remote repository

### Current Tasks in Progress
- Hardware build planning
  - Finalizing component placement strategy
  - Considering physical mounting options for wearability

### Implementation Details
- Selected specific GPIO pins for components:
  - MPU6050: Using GPIO7 (SDA) and GPIO8 (SCL) for I2C communication
  - MPU6050: Using GPIO5 for interrupt signal (optional)
  - WS2812 LED Ring: Using GPIO6 for data control
- Power management planning
  - Primary power via USB-C
  - LED brightness management to stay within power constraints
  - Decoupling capacitor for power stability

### Next Steps
1. Physical hardware assembly (to be done by Ian)
2. Implement basic test sketches:
   - MPU6050 sensor test to verify I2C communication
   - WS2812 LED test to verify control and brightness
   - Power consumption measurement
3. Begin WiFi and OTA implementation
   - Research appropriate ESP32-S2 OTA libraries
   - Create basic WiFi connection setup
   - Implement OTA update functionality
