## üîß Protocols

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Analyze** | Root cause investigation protocol for unexpected issues or behavior. Uses a structured four-step approach. |
| **Proposal** | Protocol for suggesting new solutions. Requires user approval before implementation. |
| **Double-Check** | Post-implementation verification protocol. Uses checklists to ensure structural, functional, and build integrity. |
| **Report** | Protocol for information-only responses. No code or action included. |

### Project Specific Protocols

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Audit** | Systematic process for identifying and resolving documentation-code discrepancies. Steps: 1) Initial investigation to identify all discrepancies between documentation and actual code; 2) Listing all discrepancies in a numbered format; 3) Methodical investigation of each discrepancy, one at a time; 4) For each discrepancy, gathering evidence through targeted tool usage (reading files, directory listings, grep searches); 5) Implementing a specific fix for each identified issue; 6) Performing a verification check after all fixes to ensure accuracy; 7) Final report on all discrepancies addressed and any remaining issues. Used primarily for reconciling documentation with codebase reality. |
| **Chronicle Transition** | A systematic process for transitioning between chronicle versions when a document reaches its 1000-line threshold. This protocol requires explicit user authorization before execution. The protocol defines the process for archiving the current chronicle to archive/chronicles/, creating a new version with appropriate summary information, and maintaining cross-references to preserve project history. For full details, see [ChronicleTransitionProtocol.md](../reference/ChronicleTransitionProtocol.md) |

## üî¨ Project-Specific Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Operational Modes** | The four distinct states of the PrismaTech Gauntlet: Idle Mode, Invocation Mode, Resolution Mode, and Freecast Mode. Each mode has unique behaviors, interactions, and visual feedback patterns. |
| **Hand Positions** | The six defined orientations that the gauntlet can detect: Offer (palm up), Calm (palm down), Oath (hand pointing up), Dig (hand pointing down), Shield (hand to side, palm out), and Null (hand to side, palm in). Each position has a corresponding color and is detected via the dominant axis model. |
| **Idle Mode** | The default state of the gauntlet when not actively casting. It provides real-time visual feedback of the current hand position while monitoring for trigger gestures that activate other modes. |
| **Invocation Mode** | A structured sequence where the user's hand positions are recorded into three distinct "slots" to determine the resulting spell effect. |
| **Resolution Mode** | The culmination of the invocation sequence, where the system evaluates the three imprinted positions and activates a corresponding spell effect. |
| **Freecast Mode** | A creative, freeform experience where users can generate unique light patterns by moving the gauntlet in various ways. Unlike the structured Invocation Mode, Freecast allows for more expressive and dynamic interactions. |
| **Offer Position** | Hand forward, palm up orientation. Represented by purple color (RGB: 128, 0, 128). Detected via Z-axis dominant positive. |
| **Calm Position** | Hand forward, palm down orientation. Represented by yellow color (RGB: 255, 255, 0). Detected via Z-axis dominant negative. |
| **Oath Position** | Hand pointing upwards. Represented by red color (RGB: 255, 0, 0). Detected via Y-axis dominant negative. |
| **Dig Position** | Hand pointing downwards. Represented by green color (RGB: 0, 255, 0). Detected via Y-axis dominant positive. |
| **Shield Position** | Hand to the side, palm out. Represented by blue color (RGB: 0, 0, 255). Detected via X-axis dominant negative. |
| **Null Position** | Hand to the side, palm in. Represented by orange color (RGB: 255, 165, 0). Detected via X-axis dominant positive. |
| **UBPD** | Ultra Basic Position Detection - The primary detection model for the device that converts raw accelerometer data to physical units (m/s¬≤) and uses simplified dominant axis detection with explicit thresholds to identify hand positions. |
| **Dominant Axis Detection Model** | The algorithm used for position recognition where each hand position has a primary axis that shows significantly higher values than other axes. The system detects which axis has the strongest acceleration and compares it to calibrated thresholds. |
| **CalmOffer** | A transition gesture from "Calm" position (palm-down) to "Offer" position (palm-up) within a 1000ms window. This gesture triggers the transition from Idle Mode to Invocation Mode. |
| **LongNull** | A gesture where the "Null" position (hand to side, palm in) is maintained continuously for 5000ms. This gesture triggers the transition to or exit from Freecast Mode. |
| **Invocation Slots** | Three distinct slots in Invocation Mode, each represented by 4 LEDs on the ring, which record position-based imprints to determine the resulting spell effect. |
| **Invocation Phases** | The four sequential stages of Invocation Mode: Indicator Phase (signals active slot, 1 second), Countdown Phase (visual timer, 2 seconds), Checkpoint Phase (position detection, 200ms), and Confirmation Phase (visual feedback, 1 second). |
| **Spell Effects** | The visual animations triggered in Resolution Mode based on the positions recorded in the invocation slots. Examples include Inferno, Blizzard, Wild Growth, Detect Magic, Rainbow Burst, and Rainbow Pop, each with unique animations, colors, and durations. |
| **Freecast Cycle** | The alternating sequence in Freecast Mode consisting of a 2-second Data Collection Phase (recording motion) followed by a 2-second Pattern Generation Phase (displaying motion-based visuals). |
| **MPU9250** | The motion sensor used in the gauntlet for position and gesture detection. |
| **Calibration Protocol** | Structured process for capturing sensor data to generate detection thresholds. |
| **Threshold Manager** | Component for centralizing management of detection thresholds. |

1. **Preparation**:
   - Create chronicle_vN+1.md file with standard header
   - Generate migration summary from chronicle_vN.md
   - Compile completed components, active work, critical decisions, and issues

2. **Execution**:
   - Create new entry in chronicle_vN+1.md with migration summary
   - Move chronicle_vN.md to archive/chronicles/
   - Update all references to chronicle files

3. **Verification**:
   - Ensure backwards navigability
   - Confirm chronological accuracy
   - Verify all critical information was preserved

#### Documentation Maintenance Protocol

Process for keeping documentation aligned with codebase changes.

1. **Code-First Updates**: Always update code before documentation

3. **Cross-Reference Verification**: Ensure consistency across all documentation
4. **Reference Path Validation**: Verify all file paths referenced in documentation exist

#### Full Git Commit

A comprehensive git operation that captures the complete state of the project at a specific point in time, ensuring the ability to restore the entire codebase to exactly this state if needed.

1. **Required Steps**:
   - Stage all modified files (`git add .` or targeted `git add` for all relevant files)
   - Include all new files that should be part of the project
   - Confirm removal of any deleted files
   - Create a commit with a descriptive message that summarizes the current state
   
2. **Key Characteristics**:
   - Captures the entire working directory state, not just specific files
   - Includes configuration files, documentation, and code changes
   - Creates a complete, restorable snapshot of the project
   - Preserves the relationships between components

3. **Usage Context**:
   - After completing significant work phases
   - Before major architectural changes
   - When reaching stable implementation milestones
   - At specified project checkpoints

4. **Verification**:
   - Review the git status to confirm no untracked or modified files remain
