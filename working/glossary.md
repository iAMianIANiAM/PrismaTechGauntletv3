## üîß Protocols

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Analyze** | Root cause investigation protocol for unexpected issues or behavior. Uses a structured four-step approach. |
| **Proposal** | Protocol for suggesting new solutions. Requires user approval before implementation. |
| **Double-Check** | Post-implementation verification protocol. Uses checklists to ensure structural, functional, and build integrity. |
| **Report** | Protocol for information-only responses. No code or action included. |

### Project Specific Protocols

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Audit** | Systematic process for identifying and resolving documentation-code discrepancies. Steps: 1) Initial investigation to identify all discrepancies between documentation and actual code; 2) Listing all discrepancies in a numbered format; 3) Methodical investigation of each discrepancy, one at a time; 4) For each discrepancy, gathering evidence through targeted tool usage (reading files, directory listings, grep searches); 5) Implementing a specific fix for each identified issue; 6) Performing a verification check after all fixes to ensure accuracy; 7) Final report on all discrepancies addressed and any remaining issues. Used primarily for reconciling documentation with codebase reality. |
| **Chronicle Transition** | A systematic process for transitioning between chronicle versions when a document reaches its 1000-line threshold. This protocol requires explicit user authorization before execution. The protocol defines the process for archiving the current chronicle to archive/chronicles/, creating a new version with appropriate summary information, and maintaining cross-references to preserve project history. For full details, see [ChronicleTransitionProtocol.md](../reference/ChronicleTransitionProtocol.md) |

| **DominantAxisDetectionModel** | The algorithm used for position recognition where each hand position has a primary axis that shows significantly higher values than other axes. The system detects which axis has the strongest acceleration and compares it to calibrated thresholds. |
| **Double-Check** | Post-implementation verification protocol. Uses checklists to ensure structural, functional, and build integrity. |
| **Freecast Cycle** | The alternating sequence in Freecast Mode consisting of a 2-second Data Collection Phase (recording motion) followed by a 2-second Pattern Generation Phase (displaying motion-based visuals). |
| **FreecastMode** | A creative, freeform experience where users can generate unique light patterns by moving the gauntlet in various ways. Activated/Deactivated via `LongShield`. |
| **HandPositions** | The six defined orientations that the gauntlet can detect: Offer (palm up), Calm (palm down), Oath (hand pointing up), Dig (hand pointing down), Shield (hand to side, palm out), and Null (hand to side, palm in). Each position has a corresponding color and is detected via the dominant axis model. |
| **IdleMode** | The default state of the gauntlet when not actively casting. It provides real-time visual feedback of the current hand position while monitoring for QuickCast trigger gestures (`CalmOffer`, `DigOath`, `NullShield`) and the Freecast mode trigger (`LongShield`). |

| **InvocationSlots** | **‚ö´ DEPRECATED:** Three distinct slots in Invocation Mode, each represented by 4 LEDs on the ring, which record position-based imprints to determine the resulting spell effect. |
| **LightningBlast** | A QuickCast spell effect triggered by the DigOath gesture. Features flash white, then simulated lightning crackles with red, blue, and purple, lasting for 5 seconds. |
| **LongShield** | A gesture where the "Shield" position (hand to side, palm out) is maintained continuously for 5000ms. This gesture triggers the transition to or exit from Freecast Mode. Replaced the deprecated LongNull gesture. |
| **LongOffer** | **‚ö´ DEPRECATED:** Extended duration in Offer position. Not currently used in the system. |

| **ShieldPosition** | Hand to the side, palm out. Represented by pink color (RGB: 255, 105, 180). Detected via X-axis dominant negative. |
| **SpellEffects** | The visual animations triggered by QuickCast gestures. Current implementations include Rainbow Burst, Lightning Blast, and Lumina, each with unique animations, colors, and durations. |
| **ThresholdManager** | Component for centralizing management of detection thresholds. |
| **UBPD** | Ultra Basic Position Detection - The primary detection model for the device that converts raw accelerometer data to physical units (m/s¬≤) and uses simplified dominant axis detection with explicit thresholds to identify hand positions. |

- **functionTest**: Flexible testing environment that replaces all other ad-hoc test environments

The functionTest environment is designed to be reconfigured for each new testing need. When a new test is required, the existing test code should be archived to archive/tests/ before the environment is updated with new test code.

### Development Protocols

#### Chronicle Transition Protocol

Process for transitioning from one chronicle version to the next when character limits are reached.

1. **Preparation**:
   - Create chronicle_vN+1.md file with standard header
   - Generate migration summary from chronicle_vN.md
   - Compile completed components, active work, critical decisions, and issues

2. **Execution**:
   - Create new entry in chronicle_vN+1.md with migration summary
   - Move chronicle_vN.md to archive/chronicles/
   - Update all references to chronicle files

3. **Verification**:
   - Ensure backwards navigability
   - Confirm chronological accuracy
   - Verify all critical information was preserved

#### Documentation Maintenance Protocol

Process for keeping documentation aligned with codebase changes.

1. **Code-First Updates**: Always update code before documentation
2. **Concurrent Documentation**: Update related documentation as part of the same commit
3. **Cross-Reference Verification**: Ensure consistency across all documentation
4. **Reference Path Validation**: Verify all file paths referenced in documentation exist

#### Full Git Commit

A comprehensive git operation that captures the complete state of the project at a specific point in time, ensuring the ability to restore the entire codebase to exactly this state if needed.

1. **Required Steps**:
   - Stage all modified files (`git add .` or targeted `git add` for all relevant files)
   - Include all new files that should be part of the project
   - Confirm removal of any deleted files
   - Create a commit with a descriptive message that summarizes the current state
   
2. **Key Characteristics**:
   - Captures the entire working directory state, not just specific files
   - Includes configuration files, documentation, and code changes
   - Creates a complete, restorable snapshot of the project
   - Preserves the relationships between components

3. **Usage Context**:
   - After completing significant work phases
   - Before major architectural changes
   - When reaching stable implementation milestones
   - At specified project checkpoints

4. **Verification**:
   - Review the git status to confirm no untracked or modified files remain
   - Ensure the commit message clearly identifies the project state
   - Confirm all build artifacts and environment-specific files are properly ignored
