## System Architecture & Core Concepts

This section defines the core components, relationships, and architectural patterns that form the foundation of the PrismaTech Gauntlet system.

### Components

| Term | Status | Definition |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Config** | [IMPLEMENTED] | Header-only implementation containing system-wide constants and configuration values. Serves as the central location for all configurable parameters, ensuring consistency across the system. |
| **GauntletController** | [IMPLEMENTED] | The central controller class that coordinates all subsystems, manages state transitions between operational modes, and processes user input from sensors. Acts as the main orchestrator for the entire system. |
| **LEDInterface** | [IMPLEMENTED] | Hardware abstraction layer for controlling the LED system. Provides a clean API for pattern generation, color management, and animation effects regardless of the underlying LED hardware. |
| **MPU9250Interface** | [IMPLEMENTED] | Hardware abstraction layer for the motion processing unit. Handles sensor initialization, data acquisition, and preprocessing of raw sensor data before position detection. |
| **OperationalModes** | [IMPLEMENTED] | The distinct states of the PrismaTech Gauntlet system: `IdleMode`, `QuickCastSpellsMode`, and `FreecastMode`. Each mode has specific behaviors, visual feedback patterns, and interaction models. |
| **ThresholdManager** | [IMPLEMENTED] | Component for centralizing management of detection thresholds. Stores, retrieves, and provides access to calibrated threshold values that determine hand position detection. |
| **UBPD** | [IMPLEMENTED] | Ultra Basic Position Detection - The primary detection model for the device that converts raw accelerometer data to physical units (m/sÂ²) and uses simplified dominant axis detection with explicit thresholds to identify hand positions. |

### Architectural Patterns

| Term | Status | Definition |
|------|--------|------------|
| **DominantAxisDetectionModel** | [IMPLEMENTED] | The algorithm used for position recognition where each hand position has a primary axis that shows significantly higher values than other axes. The system detects which axis has the strongest acceleration and compares it to calibrated thresholds. |
| **Non-blocking Architecture** | [IMPLEMENTED] | Design pattern where operations are structured to avoid blocking the main program flow. Ensures the system remains responsive regardless of ongoing operations. Critical for maintaining consistent timing in animation effects and sensor polling. |

| **Gauntlet** | [IMPLEMENTED] | The complete physical device, including all hardware and embedded software components that make up the wearable system. |
| **MPU9250** | [IMPLEMENTED] | The motion sensor used in the gauntlet for position and gesture detection. Provides 9-axis sensing (3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis magnetometer) with digital output through I2C or SPI. |
| **NeoPixel Ring** | [IMPLEMENTED] | Addressable RGB LED ring used for visual feedback. Typically configured with 12 or 16 LEDs in a circular arrangement, controlled via a single data pin using WS2812 protocol. |
