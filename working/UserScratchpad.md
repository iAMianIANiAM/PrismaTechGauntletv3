User Scratchpad



Thank you for your detailed analysis, and I feel I should explain. I am still learning best practices for AI-assisted programming, and failed to employ some in the last attempt to develop this device. As a result, the codebase ended up bloated, convoluted, and ultimately unable to be reconciled, which is what partially motivated this re-factor. To that end, and to answer question 1,  I actually want to limit your exposure to the previous codebase, for fear that some of the poor choices and haphazard structure will negatively affect your development of this version of the program. 

To that end, I'd rather you remove all references to the previous build of the code. We are going to try to use concepts and lessons from the previous implementation, but take a fresh, thoughtful approach to the code. 

Also, please remove any mention of confidence scoring within the True Function Document. That was a relic of some of the unnecssary complexity of the previous iteration.

To answer your questions further: 

2. I am not entirely sure either. Keep it in mind, but as mentioned, there was a lot of unnecssary bloat and symptom-chasing (while missing root causes) in the previous iteration that likely left various relics like these.

3. See answer 1. We will develop a new calibration protocol to develop a new set of appropriate thresholds. 

4. The MPU is mounted on the back of my left hand, face-down, so the sensor essentially mirrors the direction and facing of my palm. It is contained within a PETG 3D-printed custom encolsure, and contained within a neorprene glove. 

5. It is powered primarily by a USB power bank with an output of 5V/2.6A.

6. Not as of now.


Inconsistencies:

1. That is literally what is printed on the physical board of the sensor - MPU9250/6500/9255. I believe it came in an Elegoo-branded sensor kit. Let's make sure we explore and clarify this issue together as we proceed.

2. That is going to be a task that we undertake very soon - a detailed analysis of the project requirements, and the design of a project architecture that will allow us to meet those requirements. I will let you know when we undertake that task.

3. Verified. GPIO12 is the correct pin. 

4. As mentioned before, we're going to create a new calibration protocol from scratch ourselves to generate the threshold values. 

With the above in mind, please restructure your development plan and report.

Calibration Protocol:

Generate a script that will run the following calibration protocol:

- On start, the device begins a 30-second warmup period, with a softly pulsing white light for the first 25 seconds, and then a rapidly blinking brighter white light for the final 5 seconds (to allow the user to get the gauntlet on and into first calibration position.)

- The gauntlet will then display a color associated with a certain hand position, for 30 seconds. I will position my hand/the gauntlet in the designated position for the duration of the 30 seconds. The device should be transmitting data to the serial monitor for recording during this time.

- The gauntlet will proceed through each color of its posiitions, glowing that color for 30 seconds, with 5-second intervals of flashing white light in between each position (to allow time to reposition). The order will be just as listed in the True Function Document:

1. **Offer (Purple)**: Z-axis dominant positive
2. **Calm (Yellow)**: Z-axis dominant negative
3. **Oath (Red)**: Y-axis dominant negative
4. **Dig (Green)**: Y-axis dominant positive
5. **Shield (Blue)**: X-axis dominant negative with specific Z-axis requirements
6. **Null (Orange)**: X-axis dominant positive


in this way, we will basically reverse the process of the eventual "Position Detection System", with the gauntlet providing the visual prompt for the position (that would usually be feedback), and the user providing the hand position as feedback (which would normally be the input). This should give us sufficient data to calibrate our thresholds for each position and ensure clear, reliable detection of distinct hand positions. 

Ensure that we have a sufficient data collection method in place. I will perform the calibration while connected via USB to port COM7, so some means of collecting the data either from that port or from the serial monitor directly will need to be established as part of the calibration protocol. Please draft up a proposed implementation of the calibration protocol, including a suggested data collection method, and report.
