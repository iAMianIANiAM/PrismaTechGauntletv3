# Git Backup Protocol - DRAFT

## Purpose
This document outlines a formal git backup protocol to prevent data loss and maintain consistency between working documents and code implementation.

## Core Principles
1. **Frequent Commits**: Create small, focused commits tied to specific implementations
2. **Push After Significant Changes**: Regularly synchronize local and remote repositories
3. **Branch Strategy**: Use feature branches for significant work
4. **Documentation Synchronization**: Ensure working documents reflect actual code state
5. **Verification Before Commit**: Test code before committing

## Commit Protocol

### When to Commit
- After implementing a new feature or component
- After fixing a bug
- After updating documentation to reflect implementation status
- At logical stopping points in development sessions
- Never commit code that doesn't build

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <concise description>

<longer description if needed>

<reference to working documents or issues>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `refactor`: Code improvements with no functional changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Example:
```
feat: Implement UltraBasicPositionDetector

- Add unit conversion from raw data to m/sÂ²
- Implement simplified detection with absolute thresholds
- Add position-specific threshold management

References: currentplan_v2.md#L100-L110
```

## Push Protocol

### When to Push
- After completing a significant feature
- At the end of each development session
- Before making major system changes
- After synchronizing working documents with code

### Push Verification Steps
1. Verify all code builds successfully
2. Run basic tests to ensure functionality
3. Confirm working documents are updated
4. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes

## Branch Protocol

### Branch Types
- `main`: Stable, deployable code
- `feature/<name>`: New features being developed
- `recovery/<phase>`: Recovery implementation efforts
- `hotfix/<issue>`: Urgent fixes for critical issues

### Branch Management
1. Create a new branch for each significant feature
2. Keep branches focused and short-lived when possible
3. Merge completed features back to main promptly
4. Delete branches after successful merges

## Backup Verification

### Automated Verification
Implement scripts to:
- Verify all committed files exist
- Check for untracked files
- Compare working document references with actual code

### Manual Verification
Regularly:
- Review commit history
- Verify remote repository contains all expected commits
- Test repository cloning and building

## Implementation Plan
1. Adopt this protocol starting with Phase 2
2. Create verification scripts during Phase 2
3. Review and refine the protocol based on experience
4. Consider CI/CD pipeline integration in future phases

*Note: This is a draft protocol that will be reviewed and finalized during Phase 2 of the recovery plan.*
